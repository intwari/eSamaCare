# iTECH-Environmental-Protetion
iTECH commits to the conservation of natural resources by limiting human-mobility as the main cause of environmental pollution, 
mother to climate change. Reduced mobility builds the environment by reducing the rate of frictional impulse that degrades 
our natural land hence resilient to climate change.



iTECH best lies under the promotion of green technologies because it is a web and application that seeks to coordinate local 
farmers countrywide and connect them with buyers both locally and abroad from the comfort of their homes to help reduce 
the possibilities of plastic littering that may be caused by the movements of people from one place to another.
